# TODO: Integrate Scoliosis Analysis for Before/After Images

## Tasks
- [x] Implement scoliosis_fallback function in src/spin_analysis.py using edge detection, contour finding, and curvature calculation for physical scoliosis images.
- [x] Add "Scoliosis" to the diseases list in app.py.
- [x] Import scoliosis_fallback in src/skin_analysis.py and add case for "Scoliosis" in segment_lesion function.
- [x] Test integration with sample scoliosis images to ensure curvature detection and progress tracking work.
- [x] Update any necessary documentation or comments for the new scoliosis analysis.
