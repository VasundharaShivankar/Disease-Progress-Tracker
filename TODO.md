# TODO: Make the Whole System Work Properly

## Current Issues Identified
- app.py has incomplete code in __init__: header_frame not gridded, misplaced code from analyze_images method.
- Syntax is valid but code structure is broken, causing potential runtime errors.
- Models folder is empty, relying on fallbacks (acceptable for now).
- Need to verify GUI functionality, image selection, analysis, and visualization.

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Fix app.py: Complete header_frame grid placement in __init__.
- [ ] Fix app.py: Move misplaced code (update_result_text and show_visualization calls) to the correct location in analyze_images method.
- [ ] Ensure all GUI components are properly defined and placed.
- [ ] Test core imports and segmentation fallbacks.
- [ ] Run the app and verify GUI opens without errors.
- [ ] Test image selection functionality.
- [ ] Test analysis with sample images (past_lesion.jpeg and new_lesion.jpeg).
- [ ] Verify progress calculation and result display.
- [ ] Check visualization (matplotlib plots).
- [ ] Confirm no runtime errors during full workflow.

## Dependent Files
- app.py (primary fixes needed)
- src/skin_analysis.py (already functional)
- src/analysis_methods/*.py (already functional)
- data/*.jpeg (sample images present)

## Followup Steps
- After fixes, run `python app.py` and interact with the GUI.
- If issues arise, debug and fix iteratively.
- Ensure fallbacks work for all disease types.
- Test with different disease selections.
